This section introduces the fundamental Git commands you'll use daily to manage your dotfiles repository. Understanding these commands is crucial for tracking changes, collaborating (if you choose to), and maintaining a clean and organized configuration. We'll cover commands for initializing a repository, staging changes, committing those changes, viewing the repository's status, and inspecting the commit history. Mastering these basics will provide a solid foundation for more advanced Git workflows.

The core commands form a loop: you modify files, stage them using `git add`, commit them with `git commit`, and then push them to a remote repository (like GitHub or GitLab) using `git push`. The `git status` command is your friend, providing a snapshot of the current state of your working directory and staging area. The `git log` command allows you to view the commit history, providing valuable insights into past changes.

For example, after modifying your `.bashrc` file, you would use `git add .bashrc` to stage the changes. Then, you'd commit those changes with `git commit -m "Updated .bashrc with new aliases"`. Finally, `git push origin main` would push your local commits to the remote repository. These commands are the building blocks of your dotfiles management workflow.
