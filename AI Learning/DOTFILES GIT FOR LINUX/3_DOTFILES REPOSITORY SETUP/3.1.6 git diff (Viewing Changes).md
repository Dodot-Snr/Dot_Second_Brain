The `git diff` command is your window into the changes within your Git repository. It allows you to see the differences between various states of your files, whether it's comparing your working directory to the staging area, the staging area to the last commit, or even comparing different commits or branches. Understanding `git diff` is crucial for reviewing your work before committing and for understanding the history of your dotfiles.

`git diff` without any arguments shows the changes in your working directory that are _not yet staged_. This is incredibly useful for quickly checking what you've modified before adding files to the staging area with `git add`. To see the changes you've staged (i.e., the changes that will be included in your next commit), use `git diff --staged` (or `git diff --cached` in older versions of Git).

For example, if you want to see the difference between your current working directory and the last commit, you can use `git diff HEAD`. If you want to compare two specific commits, you can use `git diff <commit1> <commit2>`. This will show you all the changes that occurred between those two commits.

```bash
git diff HEAD -- .bashrc # Shows changes to .bashrc since the last commit
```
