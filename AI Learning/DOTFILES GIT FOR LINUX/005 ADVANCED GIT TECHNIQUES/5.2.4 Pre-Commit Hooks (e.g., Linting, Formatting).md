Pre-commit hooks are scripts that run automatically before a `git commit` is finalized. They provide a powerful mechanism to enforce code quality, style consistency, and prevent common errors from entering your repository. Think of them as gatekeepers, ensuring that only clean and well-formatted code makes it into your project's history. These hooks are configured within the `.git/hooks` directory of your repository, but are often managed using tools like `pre-commit` to simplify installation and configuration.

The primary benefit of pre-commit hooks is automation. Instead of relying on manual code reviews to catch issues like trailing whitespace, syntax errors, or inconsistent formatting, these hooks automatically check for and often correct these problems before the commit is even created. This saves time, reduces the burden on reviewers, and helps maintain a consistent codebase.

Examples of common pre-commit hooks include:

- **Linting:** Running linters (e.g., `flake8` for Python, `eslint` for JavaScript) to identify potential code quality issues and style violations.
- **Formatting:** Automatically formatting code using tools like `black` (Python), `prettier` (JavaScript, HTML, CSS), or `go fmt` (Go) to ensure consistent code style. For example, a Python pre-commit hook might run:
    
    ```python
    black .
    ```
    
    This command would automatically format all Python files in the current directory according to the `black` style guide.
