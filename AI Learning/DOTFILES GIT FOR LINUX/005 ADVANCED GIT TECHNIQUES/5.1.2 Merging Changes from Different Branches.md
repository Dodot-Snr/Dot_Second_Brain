Merging is the process of combining changes from one branch into another. This is a fundamental operation in Git that allows you to integrate new features, bug fixes, or experiments into your main codebase (typically `main` or `master`). When you merge, Git attempts to automatically combine the changes. However, if the same lines of code have been modified in both branches, a _merge conflict_ can occur, requiring manual resolution.

To merge a branch (e.g., `feature-branch`) into your current branch (e.g., `main`), you would first checkout the target branch (`main`) and then use the `git merge` command:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature-branch
```

If the merge is successful without conflicts, Git will create a new commit on the `main` branch that represents the combined changes. If conflicts arise, you'll need to edit the affected files to resolve them, then stage the resolved files using `git add`, and finally commit the merge with `git commit`. The commit message will typically indicate that it's a merge commit.
