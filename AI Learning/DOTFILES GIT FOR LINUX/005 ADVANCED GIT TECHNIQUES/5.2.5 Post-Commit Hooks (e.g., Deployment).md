Post-commit hooks are Git hooks that execute _after_ a commit is successfully made. Unlike pre-commit hooks, which can prevent a commit from happening, post-commit hooks are primarily used for tasks that should occur after the repository's state has been updated. These hooks are ideal for automating processes like sending notifications, triggering builds, or even deploying code to a server. Because they run after the commit, they don't block the commit process itself, ensuring a smooth workflow.

A common use case for post-commit hooks is automated deployment. Imagine a scenario where you want to automatically deploy your dotfiles to a server whenever you make changes. You could write a post-commit hook that executes a script to push the changes to a remote server, restart services, or perform other deployment-related tasks. Another example is sending a notification to a team chat channel whenever a commit is made to the dotfiles repository, keeping everyone informed about the latest changes.

Here's a simple example of a post-commit hook that sends a notification using `notify-send` (assuming it's installed):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/post-commit

commit_message=$(git log -1 --pretty=%B)
notify-send "Dotfiles Updated" "Commit message: $commit_message"
```
