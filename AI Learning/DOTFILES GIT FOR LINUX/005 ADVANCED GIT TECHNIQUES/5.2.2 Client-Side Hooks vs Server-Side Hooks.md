Git hooks are scripts that Git executes before or after events such as commit, push, and receive. They are a powerful way to customize your Git workflow and enforce specific policies. These hooks can be broadly categorized into two types: client-side hooks and server-side hooks. Understanding the difference between these two is crucial for effectively utilizing Git hooks in your dotfiles management.

Client-side hooks run on the developer's local machine. They are typically used for tasks like code formatting, linting, and preventing commits that don't meet certain criteria. For example, a `pre-commit` hook could run a code linter and reject the commit if any errors are found. Another example is a `commit-msg` hook that checks if the commit message adheres to a specific format. Because these hooks reside in the `.git/hooks` directory of each repository, they are not automatically shared or enforced across a team unless explicitly distributed (e.g., through a dotfiles repository).

Server-side hooks, on the other hand, run on the Git server. They are primarily used to enforce policies and control access to the repository. A common example is a `pre-receive` hook that prevents pushes containing commits that break the build or introduce security vulnerabilities. Another example is an `update` hook that can restrict which branches can be updated by specific users. Server-side hooks are centrally managed and enforced, ensuring consistency across all users interacting with the repository.
