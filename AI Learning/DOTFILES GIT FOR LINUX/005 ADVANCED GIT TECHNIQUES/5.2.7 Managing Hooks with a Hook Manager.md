While Git hooks are powerful, managing them directly can become cumbersome, especially across multiple repositories or when collaborating with a team. This is where hook managers come in. Hook managers provide a centralized and organized way to define, share, and execute Git hooks. They simplify the process of ensuring that all developers are using the same hooks and that these hooks are consistently applied.

Hook managers typically work by providing a configuration file (often in YAML or TOML format) where you define your hooks and their associated scripts. The manager then takes care of installing these hooks into your `.git/hooks` directory. This allows you to version control your hooks alongside your project code, ensuring that everyone on the team is using the same set of hooks. Popular hook managers include `pre-commit` and `husky`.

For example, using `pre-commit`, you can define a hook to automatically format your Python code using `black` before each commit. Your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file might look like this:

```yaml
repos:
-   repo: https://github.com/psf/black
    rev: 23.12.1  # Use the relevant version
    hooks:
    -   id: black
```

This configuration tells `pre-commit` to use the `black` formatter from the specified GitHub repository. When you run `pre-commit run`, it will automatically format your Python code and prevent the commit if the formatting fails. This ensures code consistency across your project.
