Merge conflicts arise when Git encounters conflicting changes between branches during a merge or rebase operation. This typically happens when the same lines in a file have been modified differently in the branches being merged. Git cannot automatically determine which changes to keep, so it marks the conflicting sections in the file, requiring manual resolution. Understanding how to identify and resolve these conflicts is crucial for effective collaboration and maintaining a clean and functional dotfiles repository.

When a merge conflict occurs, Git will insert conflict markers into the affected file. These markers look like `<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>> branch_name`. The section between `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======` represents the changes from your current branch (usually `main`), while the section between `=======` and `>>>>>>> branch_name` represents the changes from the branch you're merging in. To resolve the conflict, you need to edit the file, removing the conflict markers and deciding which changes to keep, or combining them as needed.

For example, imagine you have a `.bashrc` file. In your `main` branch, you've aliased `la` to `ls -la`. In a feature branch, you've aliased `la` to `ls -lAh`. After attempting to merge the feature branch into `main`, you might see something like this in your `.bashrc` file:

```bash
<<<<<<< HEAD
alias la='ls -la'
=======
alias la='ls -lAh'
>>>>>>> feature-branch
```

To resolve this, you would edit the file, choosing either `alias la='ls -la'`, `alias la='ls -lAh'`, or perhaps a combination like `alias la='ls -lAh --color=auto'`, removing the conflict markers in the process. After resolving all conflicts in all affected files, you stage the changes (`git add .`) and commit (`git commit`) to complete the merge.
