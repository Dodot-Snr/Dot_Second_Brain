Git hooks are scripts that Git executes before or after events such as commit, push, and receive. They are a powerful way to automate and customize your Git workflow. Hooks are stored in the `.git/hooks` directory of your Git repository and are typically shell scripts, but can be any executable script (e.g., Python, Ruby). By default, Git provides example hook scripts in this directory with a `.sample` extension; you'll need to remove the extension to activate them.

These hooks allow you to enforce coding standards, run tests, or perform other checks before allowing a commit or push to proceed. For example, you could use a `pre-commit` hook to run a linter and prevent commits with syntax errors. Or, you could use a `pre-push` hook to run your test suite and prevent pushing code that fails tests. This helps maintain code quality and consistency across your project.

A common example is a `pre-commit` hook that checks for trailing whitespace. Another example is a `commit-msg` hook that validates the commit message format. These hooks can be customized to fit the specific needs of your project and team.

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# A simple pre-commit hook to check for trailing whitespace

files=$(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=M | grep -v '\.lock$')

for file in $files; do
  if grep -q '[[:space:]]$' "$file"; then
    echo "Error: Trailing whitespace found in $file"
    exit 1
  fi
done

exit 0
```
