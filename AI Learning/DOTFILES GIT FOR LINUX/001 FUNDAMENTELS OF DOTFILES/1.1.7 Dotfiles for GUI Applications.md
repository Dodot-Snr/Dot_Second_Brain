Beyond the command line, many GUI applications also rely on dotfiles for configuration. These files store settings like window positions, themes, keyboard shortcuts, and other preferences, allowing you to customize the application's behavior to your liking. Unlike command-line tools, the location and format of these dotfiles can vary significantly between applications and desktop environments.

Examples of GUI application dotfiles include: `.config/Thunar` for the Thunar file manager (often storing custom actions and view settings), and `.config/gedit` for the Gedit text editor (holding preferences for font, color scheme, and plugins). Some applications might store their configuration in a single file, while others might use a directory containing multiple files and subdirectories. Understanding where these files are located is crucial for backing them up and managing them with Git, just like your shell configuration.
