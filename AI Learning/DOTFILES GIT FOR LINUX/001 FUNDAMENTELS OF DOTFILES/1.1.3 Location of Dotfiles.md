Dotfiles are typically located in your home directory on Linux and other Unix-like systems. The home directory is represented by `~` in the terminal. Most dotfiles are hidden by default, meaning they start with a `.` (dot). This is a convention to keep your home directory clean and uncluttered, as these files are usually configuration files that you don't need to access directly very often. To view these hidden files, you can use the `ls -a` command in your terminal.

Common examples of dotfiles include `.bashrc` (or `.zshrc` for Zsh users), which configures your shell environment, and `.gitconfig`, which configures Git. These files are read by their respective applications when they start, allowing you to customize their behavior. Other applications may store their configuration in hidden directories within your home directory, such as `.config/`.

Understanding where dotfiles are located is crucial for managing and backing them up. Knowing their location allows you to easily edit them, copy them to other machines, or store them in a Git repository for version control and synchronization.
