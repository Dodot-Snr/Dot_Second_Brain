After installing Git, one of the first configurations you'll want to make is setting your preferred text editor. Git uses this editor for composing commit messages, resolving merge conflicts, and other tasks that require text input. By default, Git often defaults to `vi` or `vim`, which can be intimidating for new users. Configuring a more familiar editor can significantly improve your workflow.

You can configure your Git editor using the `git config` command. The `--global` flag sets the editor for all your Git repositories. For example, to set Visual Studio Code as your editor, you would use the following command:

```bash
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
```

Alternatively, if you prefer Nano, a simpler text editor, you can configure it with:

```bash
git config --global core.editor "nano"
```

After setting your editor, Git will automatically use it whenever you need to write a commit message or perform other text-based operations. This simple configuration step can make Git much more user-friendly, especially when starting out.
