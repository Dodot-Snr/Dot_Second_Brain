After installing Git, one of the first and most crucial configuration steps is setting your user name and email address. Git uses this information to associate commits with your identity. This ensures proper attribution and collaboration within projects. Without this configuration, Git will likely warn you about the missing information and may even prevent you from committing changes.

Configuring your user information is done using the `git config` command. You can set these values globally, affecting all Git repositories on your system, or locally, affecting only the current repository. Setting them globally is generally recommended for convenience.

Here's how to set your name and email globally:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

Remember to replace `"Your Name"` and `"your.email@example.com"` with your actual name and email address. You can verify your configuration by running `git config --list`, which will display all your Git configuration settings.
