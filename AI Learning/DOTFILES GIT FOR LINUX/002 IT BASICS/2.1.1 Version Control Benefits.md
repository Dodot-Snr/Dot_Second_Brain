Version control, at its core, is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. This is incredibly powerful for managing dotfiles. Imagine accidentally deleting a crucial line from your `.bashrc` file. Without version control, you'd be scrambling to remember what it was. With Git, you can simply revert to a previous version where that line existed. This ability to track and revert changes is a fundamental benefit.

Beyond simple backups, version control enables collaboration (though less relevant for personal dotfiles, it's still a possibility if you share configurations). It also allows you to experiment with new configurations without fear. If a change breaks something, you can easily roll back to a stable state. For example, you might want to try a new theme for your terminal emulator. Using Git, you can commit your current configuration, try the new theme, and if you don't like it, revert back to your previous commit. This iterative approach to configuration management is a huge advantage.
