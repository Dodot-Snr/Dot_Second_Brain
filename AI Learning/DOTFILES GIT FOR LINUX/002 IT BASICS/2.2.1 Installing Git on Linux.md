This section covers the essential steps for installing Git on various Linux distributions. Git is a crucial tool for version control, and its installation is the first step in managing your dotfiles effectively. The installation process varies slightly depending on your distribution's package manager, but the core principle remains the same: using your distribution's package manager to download and install the Git package.

Most distributions offer Git through their default repositories. For example, on Debian-based systems like Ubuntu, you can use `apt`:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```

Similarly, on Fedora or CentOS, you would use `dnf` or `yum`:

```bash
sudo dnf install git
```

After installation, verify that Git is correctly installed by checking its version:

```bash
git --version
```

This command should output the installed Git version, confirming a successful installation. With Git installed, you're ready to configure it for use with your dotfiles repository.
