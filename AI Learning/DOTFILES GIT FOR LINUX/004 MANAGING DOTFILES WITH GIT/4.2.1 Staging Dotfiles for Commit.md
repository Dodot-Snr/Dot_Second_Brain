Before you can commit your dotfiles, you need to stage them. Staging is the process of selecting which changes you want to include in your next commit. Think of it as preparing a snapshot of your current modifications. Git uses the staging area (also known as the index) to track these changes. You can stage individual files, directories, or all modified files at once.

The most common command for staging is `git add`. For example, to stage your `.bashrc` file, you would use `git add .bashrc`. To stage an entire directory, such as `.config`, you would use `git add .config`. If you've made changes to multiple dotfiles and want to stage them all, you can use `git add .` (note the dot represents the current directory). After staging, you can use `git status` to see which files are staged and ready to be committed.

It's important to note that staging doesn't commit the changes; it only prepares them for the next commit. If you make further changes to a file after staging it, you'll need to stage it again to include those new changes in your commit. For example, if you `git add .bashrc`, then edit `.bashrc` again, you must `git add .bashrc` a second time to include the new edits in the next commit.
