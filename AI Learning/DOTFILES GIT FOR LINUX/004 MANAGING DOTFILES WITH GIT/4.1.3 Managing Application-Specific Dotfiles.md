Once you've established a basic structure for your dotfiles repository, the next step is to organize application-specific configurations. This involves creating dedicated directories or files for each application whose settings you want to manage. This approach promotes modularity, making it easier to locate, modify, and understand the configurations for individual programs. It also simplifies the process of selectively deploying dotfiles to different systems, as you can choose to install only the configurations relevant to the software installed on a particular machine.

A common strategy is to create a directory for each application within your dotfiles repository. For example, you might have a `~/.dotfiles/nvim` directory for Neovim configurations, containing files like `init.lua` and any plugin-related settings. Similarly, you could have a `~/.dotfiles/zsh` directory for Zsh configurations, including your `.zshrc` file and custom scripts. Another approach is to keep all application-specific files in a single directory, using a naming convention to identify the application. For example, `~/.dotfiles/config/nvim.lua` and `~/.dotfiles/config/zshrc`.

Consider the following example for managing your `nvim` configuration. You might have a directory structure like this:

```
~/.dotfiles/nvim/
├── init.lua
├── plugins.lua
└── snippets/
    └── python.lua
```

This structure keeps your main Neovim configuration (`init.lua`), plugin configurations (`plugins.lua`), and code snippets organized within the `nvim` directory. This makes it easy to back up, restore, or modify your Neovim settings without affecting other applications.
