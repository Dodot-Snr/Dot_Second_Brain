As your dotfiles collection grows, a flat repository structure quickly becomes unwieldy. Using subdirectories is crucial for maintaining a clean and manageable dotfiles repository. This approach allows you to group related configuration files together, making it easier to find and modify specific settings. A well-organized structure also simplifies the process of applying configurations to different systems or user profiles.

Consider organizing your dotfiles by application. For example, you might have a `nvim/` directory containing all your Neovim configuration files (e.g., `init.lua`, `lua/`, `plugin/`), a `zsh/` directory for Zsh configurations (`.zshrc`, `.zsh_aliases`, `.zsh_functions`), and a `tmux/` directory for Tmux configurations (`.tmux.conf`). This makes it immediately clear where to find the configuration files for each application.

Another common approach is to organize by functionality or system. You could have a `scripts/` directory for custom scripts, a `system/` directory for system-wide configurations, or even separate directories for different machines (e.g., `laptop/`, `desktop/`). The key is to choose a structure that makes sense for your workflow and the types of dotfiles you manage.
