Crafting clear and concise commit messages is crucial for maintaining a well-documented and understandable Git history. A good commit message explains _why_ a change was made, not just _what_ was changed. This helps you and others understand the reasoning behind specific modifications when reviewing the history later. Think of your future self (or a teammate) trying to understand why a particular line of code exists months or years down the line. A well-written commit message can save hours of debugging and frustration.

A standard format for commit messages includes a concise subject line (50 characters or less) followed by a blank line, and then a more detailed explanation in the body. The subject line should summarize the change, while the body can provide context, reasoning, and any relevant details. Use imperative mood in the subject line (e.g., "Fix bug" instead of "Fixed bug").

For example, instead of a vague message like "Updated config," a better commit message would be:

```
Fix: Resolve issue with incorrect font rendering

The previous configuration was causing font rendering issues on high-DPI displays.
This commit updates the font configuration file to use a more compatible font
and adjusts the DPI settings to ensure proper rendering across different screen resolutions.
```

Another example:

```
Feat: Add zsh-autosuggestions plugin

This commit adds the zsh-autosuggestions plugin to enhance the zsh experience.
The plugin suggests commands as you type based on history and completions,
significantly improving command-line efficiency.
