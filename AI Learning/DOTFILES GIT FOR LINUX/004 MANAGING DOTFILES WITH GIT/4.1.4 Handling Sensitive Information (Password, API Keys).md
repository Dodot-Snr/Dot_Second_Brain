When managing dotfiles with Git, it's crucial to avoid committing sensitive information like passwords, API keys, and private keys directly to your repository. Public repositories are easily accessible, and even private repositories can be compromised. Storing secrets in plain text within your dotfiles is a significant security risk.

Instead of directly including sensitive data, employ strategies to keep them separate. One common approach is to use environment variables. Your dotfiles can reference these variables, which are set outside of the repository, typically in your shell's configuration or through a dedicated secrets management tool. For example, instead of hardcoding your API key in your `.zshrc` file, you would set an environment variable `export MY_API_KEY="your_actual_api_key"` and then reference it in your dotfile as `$MY_API_KEY`.

Another popular method is to use a dedicated secrets management tool like `pass` (Password Store) or `git-secret`. These tools encrypt your sensitive data and allow you to decrypt it only when needed. You can then store the encrypted secrets in your dotfiles repository without compromising security. Remember to add any files containing sensitive information (even encrypted ones) to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental commits of the raw, unencrypted data.
