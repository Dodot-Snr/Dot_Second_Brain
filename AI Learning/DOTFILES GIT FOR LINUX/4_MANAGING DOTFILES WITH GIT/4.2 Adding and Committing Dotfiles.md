Once you've initialized your Git repository in your dotfiles directory, the next step is to start tracking the specific dotfiles you want to manage. This involves adding the files to the staging area and then committing them to your repository. The `git add` command is used to stage changes, and `git commit` saves those staged changes with a descriptive message.

To add a specific dotfile, such as your `.bashrc` file, you would use the command `git add .bashrc`. To add all modified or new files in the directory, you can use `git add .`. After adding the files, you commit them with a message using `git commit -m "Add initial .bashrc configuration"`. This message should clearly describe the changes you're committing.

For example, after customizing your `.vimrc` file, you might run `git add .vimrc` followed by `git commit -m "Customize vim settings for Python development"`. Regularly adding and committing your dotfiles ensures that you have a version-controlled history of your configurations, making it easy to revert changes or synchronize your settings across multiple machines.
