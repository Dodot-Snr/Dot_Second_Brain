When managing dotfiles with Git, you might encounter large files that can bloat your repository and slow down operations. These could be configuration files with extensive comments, large databases, or even media files mistakenly included. Git is not designed to handle large binary files efficiently, so it's crucial to manage them properly.

One common approach is to exclude large files from your repository using `.gitignore`. Add the file's name or a pattern matching the file to `.gitignore` to prevent Git from tracking it. For example, if you have a large database file named `mydatabase.db`, you would add `mydatabase.db` to your `.gitignore` file. Another strategy is to use Git Large File Storage (LFS) for files that must be versioned but are large. Git LFS replaces large files with text pointers inside Git and stores the file content on a remote server. To track a file with LFS, you would use the command `git lfs track "*.psd"` to track all Photoshop files. Remember to commit the `.gitattributes` file that LFS creates.
