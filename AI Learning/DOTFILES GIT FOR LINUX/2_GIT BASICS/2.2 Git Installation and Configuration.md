Before diving into managing dotfiles with Git, you need to ensure Git is properly installed and configured on your Linux system. This involves installing the Git package and setting up your user identity, which is crucial for attributing commits to you. Most Linux distributions offer Git through their package managers, making the installation process straightforward.

Configuration is equally important. Setting your username and email address globally ensures that every Git repository you work with will correctly identify you as the author of your changes. This information is embedded in each commit, providing a clear history of who made what changes. You can also configure other settings like your default text editor for commit messages.

For example, to set your global username and email, you would use the following commands:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

These settings are stored in your `~/.gitconfig` file.
