Git aliases are custom shortcuts for Git commands. They allow you to create shorter, more memorable commands for frequently used Git operations, saving you time and reducing the chance of typos. Aliases are defined in your Git configuration file (`.gitconfig` in your home directory) and can significantly improve your workflow.

Essentially, you're creating a new command that Git recognizes and executes as if you typed the full command. This is particularly useful for complex or lengthy commands that you use often. For example, instead of typing `git checkout -b feature/new-branch`, you could create an alias like `git newbranch feature/new-branch`.

Here's an example of how to create a Git alias:

```bash
git config --global alias.co checkout
git config --global alias.br branch
git config --global alias.st status
git config --global alias.last 'log -1 HEAD'
```

In this example, `git co` now becomes a shortcut for `git checkout`, `git br` for `git branch`, `git st` for `git status`, and `git last` shows the last commit. You can then use these aliases just like regular Git commands, such as `git co mybranch` or `git st`.
