After installing Git, securing your connection to remote repositories like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket is crucial. SSH keys provide a more secure and convenient alternative to password-based authentication. Instead of typing your password every time you interact with a remote repository, SSH keys allow you to authenticate using a private key stored on your local machine and a corresponding public key registered with the remote service.

Generating an SSH key pair involves creating a private key (which you should keep secret) and a public key (which you can share). The most common algorithm is RSA, but Ed25519 is also a secure and increasingly popular option. Once generated, you add the public key to your account settings on the remote repository platform.

For example, to generate an Ed25519 key, you would use the following command:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

After generating the key, you'll need to copy the public key (usually located in `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`) and add it to your account settings on the remote repository platform. This allows Git to authenticate you without requiring your password each time you push, pull, or clone.
