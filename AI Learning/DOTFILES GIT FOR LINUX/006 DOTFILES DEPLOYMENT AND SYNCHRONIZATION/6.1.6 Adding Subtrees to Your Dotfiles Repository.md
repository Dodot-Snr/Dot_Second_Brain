Git subtrees offer an alternative to submodules for managing dependencies or incorporating external projects into your dotfiles repository. Unlike submodules, subtrees don't create separate `.git` directories within your project. Instead, they merge the history of the external repository directly into your dotfiles repository, making it appear as if the files were always part of your project. This can simplify workflows and avoid some of the complexities associated with submodules.

To add a subtree, you'll typically use the `git subtree add` command. This command fetches the specified repository and merges it into a subdirectory of your dotfiles repository. For example, if you want to include a configuration directory from another repository into your `~/.config/my_app` directory, you could use:

```bash
git subtree add --prefix=.config/my_app <repository_url> <branch> --squash
```

The `--prefix` option specifies the directory where the subtree will be placed. The `--squash` option merges the subtree's history into a single commit, which can keep your main history cleaner. Updating the subtree later involves using `git subtree pull`, and pushing changes back to the original repository (if you have write access) uses `git subtree push`. Subtrees provide a powerful way to manage external code within your dotfiles, offering a different set of trade-offs compared to submodules.
