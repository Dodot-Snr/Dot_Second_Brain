Removing a submodule from your Git repository requires more than just deleting the submodule's directory. You need to de-register the submodule from Git's configuration and remove its entry from the index. Failing to do so can lead to errors and inconsistencies in your repository. The process involves several steps to ensure a clean removal.

First, de-initialize the submodule using `git submodule deinit <submodule_path>`. This removes the submodule's configuration from `.git/config`. Next, remove the submodule's directory from the working tree using `git rm --cached <submodule_path>`. This removes the submodule from the index. Finally, remove the submodule's entry from the `.gitmodules` file and commit the changes.

For example, if you want to remove a submodule located at `my_submodule`, you would execute the following commands:

```bash
git submodule deinit my_submodule
git rm --cached my_submodule
git commit -am "Remove submodule my_submodule"
```

After these steps, you can safely delete the submodule's directory from your working tree if it still exists. Remember to push these changes to your remote repository to ensure everyone working on the project has the updated configuration.
