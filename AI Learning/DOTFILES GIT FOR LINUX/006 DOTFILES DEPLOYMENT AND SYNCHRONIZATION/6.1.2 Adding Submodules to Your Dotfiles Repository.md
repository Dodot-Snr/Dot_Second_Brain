Submodules allow you to include other Git repositories within your dotfiles repository. This is particularly useful for managing dependencies like plugins for your shell (e.g., oh-my-zsh) or themes for your editor (e.g., vim-plug). Instead of directly copying the code into your dotfiles, you maintain a reference to the external repository, allowing you to easily update and manage these dependencies. This keeps your core dotfiles repository cleaner and more organized.

To add a submodule, use the `git submodule add` command followed by the repository URL and the desired path within your dotfiles repository. For example, to add the `oh-my-zsh` repository to a directory named `zsh/oh-my-zsh` within your dotfiles, you would run:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh.git zsh/oh-my-zsh
```

After adding the submodule, you'll need to commit the changes to your dotfiles repository. When someone clones your dotfiles repository, they'll need to initialize and update the submodules using `git submodule init` and `git submodule update --init --recursive` to actually download the code from the submodule repositories.
