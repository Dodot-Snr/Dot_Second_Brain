Manually copying dotfiles is the most straightforward, albeit least automated, method of deploying your configuration. It involves directly copying the desired dotfiles from your dotfiles repository to their respective locations in your home directory. This approach provides granular control over which files are deployed and where, making it suitable for initial setup or when only a few files need updating.

To copy a dotfile, you would typically use the `cp` command in the terminal. For example, to copy your `.bashrc` file from your dotfiles repository (located in `~/dotfiles`) to your home directory, you would use the following command:

```bash
cp ~/dotfiles/.bashrc ~/.bashrc
```

Similarly, to copy your `nvim` configuration, you might use:

```bash
cp -r ~/dotfiles/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim
```

Remember to use the `-r` flag for directories to recursively copy all files and subdirectories. While simple, this method becomes tedious and error-prone when managing a large number of dotfiles.
