Manual deployment involves directly copying your dotfiles to their intended locations on a new system. This method offers granular control and is useful for understanding the underlying file structure and configuration process. It's particularly helpful when you want to selectively apply configurations or troubleshoot issues.

The basic process involves navigating to your dotfiles repository, identifying the files you want to deploy, and then copying them to their corresponding locations in your home directory (or other relevant directories). For example, you might copy your `.bashrc` file to your home directory to customize your shell environment. Similarly, you could copy your `nvim` configuration directory to `~/.config/nvim` to configure your Neovim editor.

While manual deployment provides flexibility, it can be time-consuming and error-prone, especially with a large number of dotfiles. It's crucial to double-check file paths and permissions to avoid unexpected behavior. For instance, ensure that your `.zshrc` file is placed in your home directory and is readable by your user.
