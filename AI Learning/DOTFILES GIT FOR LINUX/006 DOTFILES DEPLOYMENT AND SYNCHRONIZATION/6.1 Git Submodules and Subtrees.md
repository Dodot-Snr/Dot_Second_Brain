Sometimes, you need to include another project within your dotfiles repository. Git offers two primary ways to manage this: submodules and subtrees. Both allow you to incorporate external repositories, but they differ significantly in how they integrate and manage the included project's history.

Submodules essentially create a pointer within your repository to a specific commit in another repository. This means the submodule's repository exists independently, and your main repository only tracks the reference. To use a submodule, you need to explicitly initialize and update it. For example, you might use a submodule to include a specific configuration file from another repository:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/example/external-config.git config/external
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Subtrees, on the other hand, merge the entire history of the external repository into your own. This creates a subdirectory within your repository that contains the files and history of the external project. Subtrees offer a more integrated approach, as the external project's files are directly part of your repository's history. An example of adding a subtree:

```bash
git subtree add --prefix=themes/my-theme https://github.com/example/theme-repo.git main --squash
```

The `--squash` option merges the subtree's history into a single commit, simplifying your repository's history. Choosing between submodules and subtrees depends on your specific needs and how tightly you want to integrate the external project.
