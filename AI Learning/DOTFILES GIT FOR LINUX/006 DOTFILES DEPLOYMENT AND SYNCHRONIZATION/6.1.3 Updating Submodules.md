Once you've added submodules to your dotfiles repository, keeping them up-to-date is crucial. Submodules, by their nature, point to specific commits within their respective repositories. This means that changes made in the submodule's repository won't automatically be reflected in your dotfiles repository. You need to explicitly update them.

The primary command for updating submodules is `git submodule update --init --recursive`. The `--init` flag ensures that any submodules that haven't been initialized yet are initialized. The `--recursive` flag ensures that any submodules within submodules are also updated. This command effectively checks out the specific commit that your main repository is tracking for each submodule.

For example, if you've made changes to a submodule located in `~/.config/nvim/plugged/vim-plug`, and you want to incorporate those changes into your dotfiles repository, you would first commit those changes within the `vim-plug` submodule itself. Then, in your dotfiles repository, you would run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to update the submodule's pointer to the new commit. Finally, you would stage and commit the changes in your dotfiles repository to reflect the updated submodule reference.

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
