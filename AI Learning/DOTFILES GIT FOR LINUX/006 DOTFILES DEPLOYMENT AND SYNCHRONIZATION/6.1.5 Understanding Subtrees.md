Git subtrees offer an alternative to submodules for managing dependencies or incorporating other projects into your repository. Unlike submodules, which create a separate repository reference, subtrees merge the history of another repository directly into your project's history. This means the entire history of the incorporated project becomes part of your repository, simplifying branching and merging operations. Subtrees are particularly useful when you want to modify the incorporated project's code directly within your main project without maintaining a separate repository link.

The key advantage of subtrees is their simplicity in terms of workflow. You don't need to initialize or update submodules separately. For example, imagine you want to include a configuration file repository into your dotfiles. You can use `git subtree add --prefix=config-files <repository_url> <branch>` to merge the repository's history into a `config-files` directory within your dotfiles repository. Any changes you make to the files in the `config-files` directory are tracked as part of your main repository's history. Similarly, you can push changes back to the original repository using `git subtree push --prefix=config-files <repository_url> <branch>`. This makes subtrees a powerful tool for managing dependencies and incorporating external projects while maintaining a clean and integrated history.
