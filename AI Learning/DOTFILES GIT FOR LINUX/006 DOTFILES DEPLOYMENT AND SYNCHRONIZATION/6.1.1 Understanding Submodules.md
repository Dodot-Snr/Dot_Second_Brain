Git submodules allow you to include another Git repository as a subdirectory within your main repository. This is useful when you have dependencies or shared components that are managed in their own Git repositories. Instead of copying the code directly, you link to a specific commit in the external repository. This maintains a clear separation of concerns and allows you to update the submodule independently.

Think of it like including a library in your project. Instead of copying the library's source code into your project, you create a link to the library's repository. When the library is updated, you can update the submodule to the latest version. A common use case is including a theme or plugin in your dotfiles repository. For example, you might have a separate repository for your `vim` plugins and include it as a submodule in your dotfiles.

To add a submodule, you would use the `git submodule add` command:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/user/my-vim-plugins.git .vim/plugins
```

This command adds the `my-vim-plugins` repository as a submodule in the `.vim/plugins` directory of your main repository. After cloning a repository with submodules, you'll need to initialize and update them using `git submodule init` and `git submodule update --init --recursive` to actually populate the submodule directories with the linked code.
