Rebasing is an alternative to merging for integrating changes from one branch into another. Unlike merging, which creates a new merge commit, rebasing rewrites the commit history of the target branch to make it appear as if it branched off from the latest commit of the base branch. This results in a cleaner, linear history, which can be easier to follow. However, it's crucial to understand that rebasing _modifies_ the commit history, which can cause problems if the branch has already been shared with others.

The basic command for rebasing is `git rebase <base_branch>`. For example, if you're on a feature branch called `my-feature` and want to rebase it onto the `main` branch, you would run `git rebase main`. This will replay your `my-feature` branch commits on top of the latest `main` branch commits. If conflicts arise during the rebase, Git will pause and allow you to resolve them before continuing with `git rebase --continue`. You can abort the rebase at any time with `git rebase --abort`.

A common use case is to keep your feature branch up-to-date with the main branch without creating merge commits. Another example is cleaning up a feature branch before merging it into main, by squashing multiple commits into a single, more descriptive commit using interactive rebasing (`git rebase -i <base_branch>`). Remember to avoid rebasing branches that have been pushed to a shared repository to prevent confusion and potential data loss for other collaborators.
