Branching and merging are fundamental concepts in Git that allow you to work on different features or fixes in isolation without affecting the main codebase. A branch is essentially a pointer to a specific commit, creating a parallel line of development. This allows you to experiment, implement new features, or fix bugs without directly modifying the `main` (or `master`) branch.

Once the work on a branch is complete and tested, it can be merged back into the `main` branch (or another branch) to integrate the changes. Merging combines the changes from one branch into another. Git automatically attempts to merge the changes, but conflicts can arise if the same lines of code have been modified in both branches. Resolving these conflicts is a crucial part of the merging process.

For example, you might create a branch called `feature/add-zsh` to add Zsh configuration to your dotfiles. After committing your changes on this branch, you can then merge it back into your `main` branch using `git merge feature/add-zsh`. If conflicts arise, Git will mark the conflicting sections in the affected files, requiring you to manually edit the files to resolve the conflicts before completing the merge.
