The `git log` command is your window into the history of your Git repository. It displays a chronological list of commits, allowing you to examine past changes, understand the evolution of your project, and identify when and why specific modifications were made. By default, `git log` shows commits in reverse chronological order (newest first), along with the commit hash, author, date, and commit message. This information is crucial for debugging, auditing, and collaborating effectively.

Beyond the basic usage, `git log` offers a wealth of options to filter and format the output. For example, `git log --oneline` provides a concise, one-line summary of each commit, making it easier to scan through the history. Another useful option is `git log -p`, which shows the full patch (diff) for each commit, allowing you to see the exact changes that were made.

Here are a couple of key examples:

- `git log`: Displays the full commit history with all details.
- `git log --author="Your Name" --since="2 weeks ago"`: Shows commits made by "Your Name" in the last two weeks.
