Before you can start tracking your dotfiles with Git, you need to initialize a new Git repository. This is the foundation upon which your version control will be built. You can initialize a repository in a new, empty directory, or within an existing directory containing your dotfiles. The key is to choose a location that makes sense for your workflow and organization.

To initialize a new Git repository, navigate to your desired directory in the terminal and use the `git init` command. This command creates a hidden `.git` directory within your chosen directory, which is where Git stores all the information about your repository, including commit history, branches, and configuration. For example, if you want to store your dotfiles in a directory named `~/.dotfiles`, you would run the following command:

```bash
cd ~/.dotfiles
git init
```

After running `git init`, you'll have a fully functional, albeit empty, Git repository ready to track your dotfiles. You can then proceed to add your dotfiles to the repository and commit them.
