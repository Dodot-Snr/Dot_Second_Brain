From the Risale-i Nur Collection 
### Synopsis

Brother! You ask me concerning the wisdom in the specified times of the five daily prayers...

Yes, just as each of the times of prayer marks the start of an important revolution so is each a mirror to divine disposal of power and to the universal divine bounties within that disposal. Thus, more glorification and extolling of the All-Powerful One of Glory have been ordered at those times, and more praise and thanks for all the innumerable bounties accumulated between each of the times, which is the meaning of the prescribed prayers...
