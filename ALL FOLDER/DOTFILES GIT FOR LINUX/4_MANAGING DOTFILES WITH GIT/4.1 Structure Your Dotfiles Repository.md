A well-structured dotfiles repository is crucial for maintainability and ease of use. There's no single "right" way, but a common approach is to organize files by application or function. This makes it easier to find and modify specific configurations. Consider creating directories for each application (e.g., `bash`, `vim`, `tmux`) and placing the corresponding dotfiles within them. You might also have a top-level `scripts` directory for any helper scripts used to manage your dotfiles.

For example, your repository might look like this:

```
.
├── bash
│   └── .bashrc
├── git
│   └── .gitconfig
├── tmux
│   └── .tmux.conf
└── scripts
    └── install.sh
```

Another popular method involves using a "dot" prefix for the actual dotfiles within the application directories. This allows you to easily distinguish between the source files in your repository and the actual dotfiles that will be symlinked or copied to your home directory. For instance, the `bash` directory would contain a file named `.bashrc`, which would then be linked to `~/.bashrc`. This approach keeps your repository clean and organized.
