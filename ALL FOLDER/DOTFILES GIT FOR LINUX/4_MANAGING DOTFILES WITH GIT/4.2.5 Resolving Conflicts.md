When working with Git, especially in collaborative environments or when switching between branches, conflicts can arise. These conflicts occur when Git is unable to automatically merge changes from different sources, usually because the same lines of code have been modified in different ways. Understanding how to resolve these conflicts is crucial for maintaining a clean and functional dotfiles repository.

Git will mark conflicted files with special markers indicating the conflicting sections. These markers typically look like `<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>> branch_name`. Your task is to manually edit the file, choosing which changes to keep, modify, or combine to create a coherent result. Once you've resolved the conflicts, you remove the conflict markers, stage the file, and commit the changes.

For example, imagine you and a collaborator both modified your `.bashrc` file. You added an alias for `la` to list all files, while they changed the default editor. When you try to merge their changes, Git will flag a conflict in `.bashrc`. You'll need to open the file, examine the conflicting sections, and decide whether to keep your alias, their editor change, both, or a modified version of either. After editing, you'd run `git add .bashrc` and `git commit -m "Resolved conflict in .bashrc"`.
