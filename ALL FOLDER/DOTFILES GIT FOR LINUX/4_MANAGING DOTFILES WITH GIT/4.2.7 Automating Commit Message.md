Automating commit messages can significantly improve your dotfiles workflow by ensuring consistency and reducing manual effort. Instead of typing out a message every time you commit, you can leverage Git hooks or command-line tools to generate them automatically based on the changes you've made. This is especially useful for small, frequent commits where the message is often repetitive.

One common approach is to use a `prepare-commit-msg` hook. This hook allows you to modify the commit message before the editor is opened (or before the commit is finalized if you're bypassing the editor). For example, you could create a script that checks which dotfiles have been modified and automatically generates a message like "Update: .bashrc, .vimrc" based on the changed files.

Another example involves using a tool like `git-cz` (Commitizen) or similar utilities that enforce a specific commit message format. These tools guide you through a series of prompts to create a structured commit message, ensuring that all commits adhere to a predefined standard. This can be particularly helpful when collaborating with others or when you want to maintain a highly organized commit history.
