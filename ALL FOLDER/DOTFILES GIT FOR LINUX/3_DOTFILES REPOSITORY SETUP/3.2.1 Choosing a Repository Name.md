Selecting a good name for your dotfiles repository is more important than you might initially think. A well-chosen name makes it easier to remember, share, and distinguish your repository from others. While there's no single "right" answer, aiming for clarity and conciseness is generally a good approach.

Common conventions include using `dotfiles`, `dotfiles-linux`, or even your username followed by `dotfiles` (e.g., `john-dotfiles`). The `dotfiles` name is simple and widely understood. Adding `-linux` clarifies that the repository is specifically for Linux configurations. Using your username can be helpful if you have multiple dotfiles repositories for different purposes.

Ultimately, the best name is one that you find memorable and descriptive. For example, if you heavily customize your Vim configuration, you might consider a name like `dotfiles-vim`. Just remember to keep it relatively short and easy to type!
