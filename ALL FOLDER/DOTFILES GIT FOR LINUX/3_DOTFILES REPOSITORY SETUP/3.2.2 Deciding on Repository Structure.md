Choosing the right repository structure is crucial for managing your dotfiles effectively. A well-organized structure makes it easier to find, update, and deploy your configurations across different machines. There's no single "best" way, but the goal is to create a system that's intuitive and maintainable for _you_.

One common approach is to mirror the directory structure of your home directory. For example, you might have a `~/.config/nvim/init.vim` file. In your dotfiles repository, you would create a corresponding `config/nvim/init.vim` structure. This makes it easy to understand where each file should be placed when deploying your dotfiles. Another approach is to group dotfiles by application, regardless of their location in the home directory. This might involve a top-level directory for each application, such as `nvim/init.vim` and `zsh/.zshrc`.

Ultimately, the best structure depends on your personal preferences and the complexity of your dotfiles. Consider how frequently you'll be modifying different files and how you plan to deploy them. Experiment with different structures until you find one that works best for your workflow.
