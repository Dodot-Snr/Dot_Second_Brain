When managing dotfiles with Git, creating a _bare_ repository is the recommended approach. A bare repository doesn't contain a working directory; instead, it only holds the Git history and metadata. This prevents accidental modification of the dotfiles within the repository itself and keeps your home directory clean. It also avoids Git trying to track your entire home directory, which is generally undesirable.

To create a bare repository, you'll use the `git init --bare` command. For example, you might create a directory named `.dotfiles` in your home directory and initialize it as a bare Git repository:

```bash
mkdir ~/.dotfiles
git init --bare ~/.dotfiles
```

This command creates a hidden directory `.dotfiles` containing the Git repository's internal structure, but without any actual files. This is where Git will store all the changes and history of your dotfiles. The next step involves creating an alias to easily interact with this repository.
