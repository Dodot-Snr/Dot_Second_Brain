Before making any changes to your dotfiles, it's crucial to create backups of the original files. This allows you to easily revert to a working state if something goes wrong during the deployment process. Think of it as a safety net that prevents you from accidentally breaking your system configuration. Backups are especially important when manually deploying dotfiles, as there's a higher chance of human error compared to automated methods.

The simplest way to create backups is by copying the original dotfiles to a separate directory. For example, if you're modifying your `.bashrc` file, you can create a backup like this:

```bash
cp ~/.bashrc ~/.bashrc.bak
```

This command creates a copy of your `.bashrc` file named `.bashrc.bak` in your home directory. You can then safely modify the original `.bashrc` file, knowing that you have a backup to restore if needed. Another common practice is to create a dedicated backup directory for all your dotfiles, such as `~/dotfiles_backup`. This helps keep your backups organized and easily accessible. Remember to name your backup files descriptively, including the date or a version number, to easily identify them later.
