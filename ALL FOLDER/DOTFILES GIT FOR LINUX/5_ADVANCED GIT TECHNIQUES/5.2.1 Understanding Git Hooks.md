Git hooks are scripts that Git executes before or after events such as commit, push, and receive. They are a powerful way to automate and customize your Git workflow. Hooks are stored in the `.git/hooks` directory of your Git repository and are typically shell scripts, but can be any executable script (e.g., Python, Ruby). By default, Git provides example hook scripts with a `.sample` extension; you'll need to remove this extension to activate a hook.

These hooks allow you to enforce coding standards, run tests, or perform other tasks automatically. For example, you could use a `pre-commit` hook to run a linter and prevent commits with syntax errors. Another common use case is a `pre-push` hook that runs unit tests before allowing code to be pushed to a remote repository. This helps ensure that only working code is pushed, preventing integration issues.

Here's a simple example of a `pre-commit` hook (written in bash) that checks for the presence of the string "TODO" in the staged files:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
if git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM | xargs grep -q TODO
then
  echo "Aborting commit.  TODO found in staged files."
  exit 1
fi
```
